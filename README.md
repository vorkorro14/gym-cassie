# gym-cassie
An OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning interface for Agility Robotics' biped robot Cassie.

# Installation
1. Install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
2.  Place ```mujoco210/``` in the ```$HOME/.mujoco``` folder (see http://www.mujoco.org/ for info on downloading MuJoCo). 
4.  Run ```$ pip3 install -e .``` in root folder (the one that contains setup.py). 

Note: I'm currently including a binary of the Cassie MuJoCo C library libcassiemujoco.so in gym_cassie/cassiemujoco (see: https://github.com/osudrl/cassie-mujoco-sim). If you'd like to modify/build that binary from source, note that this repo currently uses a modified version of cassie-mujoco-sim with a foot position API. For now see my fork of the former here: https://github.com/p-morais/cassie-mujoco-sim.

To test installation:
```
$ python3
> import gym
> import gym_cassie
> env = gym.make("Cassie-v0")
> env.render()
> env.close()
```
Alternatively:
```
$ python3
> from gym_cassie import CassieMimicEnv
> env = CassieMimicEnv("walking")
> env.render()
```

# Environments
* **Cassie-v0**: A "go forward" environment meant to be a close match to OpenAI gym's Humanoid environment in terms of state and reward. **Important**: This environment is a work in progress and its implementation details will change over time as reward coefficients etc. are empirically determined. Do not yet necessarily expect it to produce a reasonable policy.

* **Cassie-mimic-v0**: A faithful reimplementation of the environment described in [Feedback Control For Cassie With Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05580). Also see [DeepMimic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02717).





# TODO
* [ ] Add the option to use the Cassie state estimator output as the observation (this would allow policies to be run on the actual robot).
* [ ] Package cassiemujoco as an independent sub-package.
